#CHANGELOG & FUNCTIONALITIES OF EVERY VERSION:

V0.0 - Calls the default system shell for all commands, is basically just a slightly modified UI.

V0.1 - Adds a help function, aliases for exit and a utility that can roll a dice, toss a coin, generate a random number between a minimum and a maximum and pick a choice from a given list.

V1.0 - Adds an echo function, support for multiple commands at once (separeted using commas and a space [for example: echo hello, echo world]), and support to install python libraries via pip and apps via Winget or apt.
